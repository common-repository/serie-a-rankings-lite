== Description ==

This plugin adds a simple, straightforward scroller to your website, which rotates the latest Premier League Rankings. The scroller's feed is update multiple times per week, so that your blog visitors can get the most stats.

This plugin is licensed under WordPress.org guidelines and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">General Public License</a>.

If the blogger is interested in more advanced stats, a link to a website with more information is provided on the plugin's control panel page. Note, NO links to advanced stats plugins are advertised within the stats output that appear on the blog itself. The display on the blogger's website is completely, 100% ad free.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `serie-a-rankings-lite` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The Plugin will automatically install a new option in your WP options table to save important plugin variables.
4. It might be necessary to upload a `crossdomain.xml` file to your website's root folder (where the `wp-config.php` file is stored). This file allows the Flash news scroller to function much more efficiently, and restricts access to our server only. If you need this file, you will be alerted in the Scroller settings panel, and offered a download link to get the file.
5. Go to your Design section and select the Power Rankings Scroller widget.
6. Place the widget where you would like it to appear in your sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will new features be added? =

Yes, we will make changes to the diplay from time to time. These changes will appear automatically on your blog.

= My sidebar (or part of my sidebar) disappeared after I installed this plugin, what happened? =
